A project created for me to better understand C++ and the SFML library.

The goal is to create an app that can solve and possibly create new sudoku.

As of now there is:
  - a writable sudoku grid - classic sudoku number grid that reacts to mouse events and when active also specific key presses (numbers to write, backpase and delete to erase and arrows to move around the grid)
  - a button that reacts to mouse events but without functionality

Next goals:
  - Creating an algorithm to solve sudoku game based on the grid input and hooking it up to the button
  - Creating an GUI for creating new sudoku with several difficulty levels with help of solving algorithm
  - Optimizing and polishing code in the end
